======= MORCUTOOL =======

A tool for mass exporting files from the MySims series .package archives. 

It currently supports both MySims Agents and MySims Skyheroes, as they were incompatible
with the existing package editors designed for The Sims 3.

This program also converts MySims Skyheroes models to .dae.



======= USAGE NOTES =======

Before extracting a MySims Agents package, it is strongly recommended that you load one of the game's vault files 
so that the filenames are correct. This option can be found under Utility > Load Vault.
