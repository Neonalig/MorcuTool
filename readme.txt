======= MORCUTOOL =======

A tool that opens MySims series .package archives. 

It currently supports packages from MySims Kingdom, Agents, and Skyheroes.
You can then export the individual files stored in the archive. (or, in the case of Skyheroes, it dumps them all automatically)

This program also converts MySims Skyheroes models to .obj. (You may have to set the deprecated radio button accordingly for this to work).


======= USAGE NOTES =======

Before extracting a MySims Agents package, it is strongly recommended that you load one of the game's vault files 
so that the filenames are correct. This option can be found under Utility > Load Vault.
