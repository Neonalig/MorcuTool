### MorcuTool

A tool that opens MySims series .package archives, which are slightly different in format to normal package archives.
It also has the ability to convert and export the various data files found within (3D models, textures, etc.).

It currently supports packages from MySims, MySims Kingdom, Agents, and Skyheroes.
You can then export the individual files stored in the archive. (or, in the case of Skyheroes, it dumps them all automatically)

This program is also capable of converting some, but not all Skyheroes character models to .obj.

### Usage notes

Before extracting an Agents package, it is strongly recommended that you load one of the game's vault files 
so that the filenames are correct. This option can be found under Utility > Load Vault.
