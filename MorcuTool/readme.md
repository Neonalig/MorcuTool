### MorcuTool

A tool that opens Maxis .package archives and allows the user to export the files inside, and in some cases convert them to more easily-viewable formats, like OBJ models and PNG images.
This is particularly for .package versions that are not widely supported elsewhere; i.e. not Sims 3 or Sims 4, which already have their own bespoke programs elsewhere on the internet.

MorcuTool currently supports packages from:
*Spore
*MySims
	*Kingdom
	*Agents
	*Skyheroes

### Usage notes

Before extracting an Agents package, it is strongly recommended that you load one of the game's vault files 
so that the filenames are correct. This option can be found under Utility > Load Vault.
